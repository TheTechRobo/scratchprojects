ScratchOS is an operating system made to have a consistent interface and run fast. 
This version is by TtR. 
If I can reach 125 likes (hearts), I will remix a Windows 7!! (I like to remix.) 

Programs: 
Camera
Settings
Pong
Logs (Press r, and then type logs to access; type cLog to close) 
For feedback::: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/239483507/#player
I have burned (figuratively) my original plans for Assistant, so Assistant will never be done unless I am committed.

Sorry for the wait, last update was 1 nov 2018 but now it's 14 dec 2018. sorry but...
1.0.6.7: For some odd reason, the "delete name for assistant?" thing changes the name for what your name IS! So I renamed the question for more sense and fixed a few glitches
CRITICAL UPDATE -- UPDATE NOW!! : The password field is asking for the WRONG variable! I fixed this because I got locked out. 
1.0.6.8: "Day of the week" variable was misplaced, because of the new, larger variables it covered the 'Year' variable  Also, I will NEVER get to 1000 likes, so I changed the goal to 125 (an eighth)

KNOWN_BUGS
----------
Unfortunately there seems to be many bugs now in Scratch 3.0, though I'm not sure if that's the issue.

Graphics suck

Camera app does not seem to work.

Assistant does not work.

UPDATE: Those bugs seem to be my fault : the original (non remix) works fine. (Well it doesnt have the assistant and its graphics arent that good either but........)
